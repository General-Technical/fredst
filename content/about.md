At FRED St our desire is to create a landscape architecture group that provides innovative ideas and delivers outstanding design outcomes. By drawing upon our extensive and varied project experience and detailed technical expertise, we will deliver unique and responsive project solutions with a personalised, efficient and dynamic approach.

We offer full landscape architectural and urban design services as well as specialist 3D visualization from our design studio in Woolloongabba. Our efficient corporate structure enables us to meet the time frame and budgetary expectations of our clients whilst also consistently providing a personalized design service that is innovative, fully resolved and technically excellent. We deliver the solution, priding ourselves on our ability to work with teams of co-consultants, from the most straightforward projects to the most complex.

We’ve been involved in many projects for various sectors. Ranging from very small pro bono’s for schools to the largest major infrastructure projects in South East Queensland including Airport Link, Legacy Way and Brisbane Metro.

Our strengths lie in being able to see the ‘big idea’ with strong a conceptual vision and excellence in communication. We have the capability to provide cutting edge graphic visualisation for presentations and an attention to detail that is apparent in highly resolved construction documentation. Our projects are characterised by ensuring resources are used in the most effective way, integrating necessary infrastructure with urban design elements and improved community outcomes.

‘At the core of our design approach are collaborations that have lasting social benefits and that support a sustainable, robust and diverse community. We explore innovative ways to meld design and lifestyle, always ensuring the outcome is in-keeping with our client’s visions.’
