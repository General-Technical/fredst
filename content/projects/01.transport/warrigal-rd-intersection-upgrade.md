Working within the framework of Brisbane City Council standard
guidelines, FRED St delivered a design outcome that improved the local
streetscape function whilst maintaining a cohesive neighbourhood
aesthetic. Robust, native species were specified to the verges with
protection given to the new and existing street trees. The path the landscape improvements are found upon allow for greater amenity and function, enabling a more active lifestyle.
