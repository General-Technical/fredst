(works completed by T. Leggo whilst employed by RPS) A hugely successful bid that placed major importance on the urban design outcome, with participation in value engineering and optioneering workshops within the bid phase to ensure the best design outcome was presented. The Transcity Consortium was awarded the $1.5 billion tender to design, construct, manage and operate Legacy Way (previously known as Northern Link) – a 4.3km long underground toll road which will join Toowong and Bowen Hills in Brisbane. Scope of works include the design of tunnel portals, ventilation facilities, noise barriers and the toll road control centres, as well as all soft landscape works and the Mt Coot-tha Botanic Gardens expansion masterplan, with increased open space and recreational opportunities. The design includes the provision of a ‘moving wall’ portal entry feature that creates a dynamic entry and exit experience to the tunnels and links to the artwork on the ventilation building façade.
