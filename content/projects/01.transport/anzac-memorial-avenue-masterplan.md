To mark the Centenary of ANZAC in 2015, 100 street trees have been proposed, to be placed between the Northâ€™s Leagues Club at Petrie and the East end of Kallangur Central. Design constraints considered for the roadway project included road alignment, services (namely electricity), pedestrian facility, remaining heritage trees, safety standards and sight lines. A visual document was created exploring these constraints and containing extensive research, resulting in a detailed conceptual masterplan of the proposed tree locations
