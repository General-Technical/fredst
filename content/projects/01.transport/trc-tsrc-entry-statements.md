FRED St worked with Toowoomba Regional Council to deliver a fully
researched, analysed and robust masterplan for the entry statements associated
with the interchanges of the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. With the
Toowoomba Range being a natural barrier in QLD, this second crossing is an
opportunity to position Toowoomba as ‘the gateway’ to the region’s west and
east. The Masterplan ensures the delivery of entry statements, which are of
appropriate size and scale, are placed to gain the longest and most impactful
view for motorists, and has elements truly representative of the Masterplans’
theme and design intent. Flora is the them used to articulate is our unified
connection to living in and on this land.
