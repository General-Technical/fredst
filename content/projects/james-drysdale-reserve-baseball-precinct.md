FRED St designed and documented the baseball grounds for James
Drysdale Reserve. This included the sport field design, dugout design and
layout and the field subsurface drainage design. The ancillary elements to the
reserve that were also developed from concept design were the playground,
exercise nodes and amenity landscape.
