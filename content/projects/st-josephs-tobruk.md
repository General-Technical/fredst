By reimagining necessary infrastructure, a design was developed
which offered accessibility, multiple affordances, and a heart space for St
Joseph's School. Through dilligent site analysis, an outcome was achieved that
activated under-utilised areas, repositioned valued sight lines, and restored
principles upon which the school was founded.
