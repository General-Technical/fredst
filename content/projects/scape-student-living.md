Fred St designed and documented internal, external, and streetscape
works for this multi-level student accommodation project. A rooftop common
area was appointed with BBQ facilities and a mix of moveable and fixed seating
options with large planting troughs providing distinction between seating
areas. In the centre of the building, an expansive internal garden was planted
with native palms and ferns to suit the building microclimate.
