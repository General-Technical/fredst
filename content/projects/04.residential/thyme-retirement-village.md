The landscape project for Thyme retirement village centered on creating nature-inspired spaces with a focus on native planting to promote sustainability and local biodiversity. Two small community parks were thoughtfully integrated, offering residents a peaceful pocket park for relaxation and a croquet field with barbecues for social gatherings. Native plantings provide low-maintenance beauty and support the surrounding ecosystem. The design fosters a sense of connection to nature and community for all residents.
