FRED St delivered the external works for the Mudgee Retirement Village. Mudgee's unique climate compared to FRED St's home base provided an exciting opportunity to explore and feature a diverse selection of plant species. The project required the design to harmoniously mix communal, public, and private spaces, ensuring safe access was achieved site-wide.
