The landscape project for the Otto apartment complex focused on creating a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly streetscape that seamlessly integrates green street appeal into the walkways. Emphasizing opportunistic planting, the design enhances the overall aesthetic and functionality of the urban environment. Sustainable planting practices and thoughtful hardscaping elements contribute to both visual appeal and ecological benefits.
