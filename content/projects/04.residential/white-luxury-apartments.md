Exuding style and sophistication White’s landscape drips from carefully placed tiers and terraces.  Each planting composition sits within the whole, creating a multi-layered, complex scheme.  The frontage planter stretch from the ground floor, up stepped mezzanines and to the Level 2 recreation deck.  Complimented with dense screening, trailing and climbing plants, this will keep growing into it’s maximum potential for a number of years. This project won the Landscape Queensland Construction Excellence Award for it’s category Commercial 1 for Naturelink.
