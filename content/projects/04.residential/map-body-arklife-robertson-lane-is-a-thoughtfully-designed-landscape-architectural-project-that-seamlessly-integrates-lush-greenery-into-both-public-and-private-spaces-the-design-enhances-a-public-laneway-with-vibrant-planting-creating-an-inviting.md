Arklife Robertson Lane is a thoughtfully designed landscape architectural project that seamlessly integrates lush greenery into both public and private spaces. The design enhances a public laneway with vibrant planting, creating an inviting, pedestrian-friendly streetscape that encourages social interaction. Simultaneously, the project provides a private rooftop retreat for residents, featuring a tranquil pool deck surrounded by carefully curated landscaping. This balance between urban vitality and natural serenity reflects a commitment to sustainability and community well-being. By incorporating greenery at multiple levels, the project fosters a strong connection between people and nature, enriching both the public realm and private living experience.
