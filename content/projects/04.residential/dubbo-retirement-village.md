FRED St was engaged to deliver the external works package for Oak Tree Group's Dubbo Retirement Village. This project involved the curation of community, public and private spaces, ensuring a seamless flow between each both in materiality and accessibility. Dubbo's climatic conditions differ from that of FRED St's local area, providing an opportunity to demonstrate new plant species selections and arrangements.
