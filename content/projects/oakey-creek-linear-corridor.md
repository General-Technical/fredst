FRED St worked with Toowoomba Regional Council on the delivery of
the detailed design for the Oakey Creek Corridor. Taking the direction from a
previously commissioned masterplan, Fred St developed the design to provide
the means to establish this series of parklands as a linked District Level
recreational asset. This project received the AILA Queensland 2018 Regional
Achievement Award.
