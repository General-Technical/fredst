Unique design thinking characterised the approach for the high-rise
residential apartment Opus development. An entry garden bed visually links the
streetscape and pool deck, while softening the angled surrounds. Large planter
troughs provide a weight and cost-saving alternative to blockwork, forming the
perimeter of the second level lounge area which links to BBQ facilities which
were custom designed to offer universal access.
