(whilst employed at RPS) Airport Link’s green wall and purple
curtain wall have become landmarks in Brisbane’s road network. The curtain
wall’s design demonstrates a gateway that is responsive to the engineering
adjacent to it and the importance of scale. Dual use is key to our philosophy.

Tessa Leggo delivered the curtain wall that was developed as a JV with Taylor
Cullity Leathlean (TCL). She also integrating the curtain wall’s aesthetic
into the public park that was completed as a part of the works. The scope of
works for Southern Connection was extensive and included the design of
signature portal entries, noise walls and ventilation facilities, along with
the creation of new land bridges for park space and the integration of
existing and new public realm into the design. High level of coordination
between urban design and the engineering teams are the hallmarks of this
project as is the design of significant elements of this landmark
infrastructure project.
