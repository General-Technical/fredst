Fred St were engaged to design a private garden to complement and
enhance the evolution of a suburban character residence into offices and
counselling rooms for the Mercy Partners. The role of the garden in this
project is significant as it directly nourishes the spiritual practice of
those accessing the complex. Places to gather, contemplate and learn all form
an overall landscape design that embodies a depth of meaning and breadth of
experience at an intimate scale. This project received the AILA Queensland
2020 Landscape Architecture Award for Small Projects.
