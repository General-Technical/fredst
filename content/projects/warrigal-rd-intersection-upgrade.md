Working within the framework of Brisbane City Council standard
guidelines, FRED St delivered a design outcome that improved the local
streetscape function whilst maintaining a cohesive neighbourhood
aesthetic. Robust, natice species were specifyied to the verges with
protection given to the existing street trees which were also supplemented
where possible. The path the landscape improvements are allowing greater
amenity and function enable a more active lifestyle.
