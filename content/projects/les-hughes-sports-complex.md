FRED St designed and documented the landscape for the Les Hughes
Precinct Upgrade. The upgrade included a new joint baseball/rugby clubhouse,
new rugby fields, and car parking. Our scope included the sport field design,
baseball practice compound design and layout as wewll as the field sub-surface
drainage design. The ancillary elements that were also developed from concept
design were the seating, path connections and amenity landscape.
