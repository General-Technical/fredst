The Carol to Laurinda shared active transport corridor demonstrates
Fred Stâ€™s ability to design fluid and functional spaces that enhance community
access. The site is an extended parkland that joins Carol Avenue with Laurinda
Crescent, involving the upgrade of existing parkland, along with design of an
adjacent resumed block to create the corridor. This project received the AILA
Queensland 2022 Small Projects Award of Excellence.
