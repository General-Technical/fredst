description: FRED St was engaged by Brisbane City Council to provide the Urban
  Design and Landscape Masterplan for the signature linear riverside parkway and
  urban boulevard which forms part of the iconic Kingsford Smith Drive Upgrade
  Project. Our scope of works included the provision of full landscape concept
  designs for all of the riverside parkland spaces along KSD, including the
  heritage listed Cameron Rocks Reserve, and an exciting new destinational
  riverside events space at Bretts Wharf. We were also responsible for the
  design and integration of a number of smaller parkland nodal points along the
  2.4km riverside walkway component to provide respite and interest for
  pedestrians and cyclists traveling along the new riverside boulevard
  promenade. FRED St was awarded the 2016 AILA Award of excellence and received
  a commendation for Policies, Programs and Concepts - Large Scale in the 2016
  Australian Urban Design Awards.
