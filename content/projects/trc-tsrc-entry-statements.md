description: FRED St worked with Toowoomba Regional Council to deliver a fully
  researched, analysed and robust masterplan for the entry statements associated
  with the interchanges of the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing.  With the
  Toowoomba Range being a natural barrier in QLD, this second crossing is an
  opportunity to position Toowoomba as ‘the gateway’ to the region’s west and
  east.  The Masterplan ensures the delivery of entry statements which are of
  appropriate size and scale, is placed to gain the longest and most impactful
  view for motorists, and has elements truly representative of the Masterplans’
  theme and design intent.  Flora is the them used to articulate is our unified
  connection to living in and on this land.
