Following the construction of a new building, FRED St developed the existing tired courtyard to blend together the two areas and better meet the needs of the school. Creative ground surfacing, seating arrangements and garden beds activate one side whilst custom poppy murals celebrate the ANZAC's and provide historical teaching opportunities on the other.
