FRED St was engaged to activate previously unused space at Manly State School, delivering a custom designed boat-themed play unit, complete with a crowâ€™s nest and slide, offering imaginative and active play. Decking around a mature tree creates a shaded gathering space, bridging the gap literally and figuratively between passive and active spaces. Complemented by additional play elements for further exploration, the design navigates grade changes to connect the playground with the school oval, enhancing the flow and functionality of the space.
