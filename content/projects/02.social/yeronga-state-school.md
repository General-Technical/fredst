Fred St created a thoughtful landscape design that brought cohesion to previously disconnected areas through nature and function based elements. Addressing challenges like steep embankments, erosion, and undefined circulation, the design transformed complex terrain into a functional and engaging space that better relates to the adjacent oval context. Key features include terraced seating, meandering creek beds, decking to tree protection zones, and nature play connections through native garden bedsâ€”enhancing both usability and natural beauty.
