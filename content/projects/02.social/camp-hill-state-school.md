Fred St was engaged to remediate a free play area that had suffered
degradation and loss of surface materials due to unmanaged gradients and lack
of circulation structure. Terraces and retaining walls were employed to
provide stability to the sloping site, while rock swales were placed to
interrupt and redirect damaging water flow paths. Dedicated travel paths were
designed to offer universal access and protection of previously trampled
rootzones.
