The Coorparoo Secondary College project transforms a time-worn courtyard into an elegant and inclusive garden space, reflecting the schoolâ€™s identity and commitment to supporting Indigenous students and community. The space was designed in consultation with First Nations Elders Aunty Peggy Tidyman, Aunty Pat Williams, and Uncle Troy Thompson, and includes an Outdoor Learning Area, Yarning Circle, and native plantings to encourage cultural connection, learning, and community engagement. Grounded in the elements of Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, the design honours Country and creates a place of belonging, respect, and environmental awareness for students and the wider community. This project received the Award for Excellence - Health and Education Landscape from AILA QLD.
