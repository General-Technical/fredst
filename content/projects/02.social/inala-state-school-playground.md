This landscape project at Inala State School celebrates the natural beauty of the site by thoughtfully integrating play around mature gum trees and introducing a towering timber play structure that reaches skyward. Nature play elements like bridges, creek beds, and climbing rocks create a dynamic and engaging environment for exploration and imagination. Complemented by native plantings, the space invites connection with nature while encouraging active, creative, and grounded play.
