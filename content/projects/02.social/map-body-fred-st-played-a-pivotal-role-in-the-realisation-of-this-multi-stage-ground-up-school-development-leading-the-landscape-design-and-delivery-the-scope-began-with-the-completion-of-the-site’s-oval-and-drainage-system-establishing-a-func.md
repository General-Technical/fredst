FRED St played a pivotal role in the realisation of this multi-stage, ground-up school development, leading the landscape design and delivery. The scope began with the completion of the siteâ€™s oval and drainage system, establishing a functional wetland that applies water sensitive urban design principles to manage stormwater sustainably. Subsequent stages delivered a seasonally responsive planting palette, premium materials, and a cohesive, pedestrian-focused layout made possible by the fully integrated, comprehensive design approach.
