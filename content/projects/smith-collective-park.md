description: Smith Collective Park was delivered in concept design and detailed
  design stages as part of upgrades to the public facilities at Commonwealth
  Games Village. Centrally located within a residential precinct, the aim was to
  provide the community with an all ages and abilities recreational space. In
  this constricted site,  the selection of play equipment optimised space and
  supported ease of access through the space. Landform was strategically used to
  generate the most play potential within tight spaces.
