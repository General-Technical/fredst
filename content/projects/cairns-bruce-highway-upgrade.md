description: (whilst employed at RPS) Cairns Bruce Highway Upgrade required a
  noise barrier and the created highpoint of the overpass guided the ‘Wave’. We
  delivered a linear gateway feature that addressed noise mitigation concerns,
  highlighted views to Cairns city foreshore, addressed time/effect difficulties
  for public art in a driving context and provided an entrance feature that can
  be viewed from all possible angles with no loss of effect. The ability to
  understand and articulate the needs of urban design in this setting is
  invaluable for infrastructure urban design. Tessa also designed the urban
  design treatments to the pedestrian overpass bridge, having to accommodate
  several governing bodies safety standards and aesthetic desires
