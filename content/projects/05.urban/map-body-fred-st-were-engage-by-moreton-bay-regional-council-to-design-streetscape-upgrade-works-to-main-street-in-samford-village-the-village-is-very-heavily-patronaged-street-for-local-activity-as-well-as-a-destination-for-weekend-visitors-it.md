FRED St were engage by Moreton Bay Regional Council  to design streetscape upgrade works to Main Street in Samford Village. The village is very heavily patronaged street for local activity as well as a destination for weekend visitors.  It needed to be able to cater for large boosts in numbers in different periods, without losing the rural and village character that Samford is known and appreciated for. We carefully looked at what the existing character was and inserted improvements that brought seemingly disparate streetscape elements into one cohesive area. We also provided new nodes for streetside dining and casual social interactions. DDA compliance was a major desire of Councils, with bespoke solutions provided within the streetscape to several retail outlets that experience level differences at the front boundary. These all combine to provide the community with a more function, comfortable and beautiful streetscape for them to enjoy and meet in.
