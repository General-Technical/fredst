The Wyandra Lane Subdivision Masterplan transforms a former rural cattle pasture into a vibrant residential community that celebrates ecology, connectivity, and wellbeing. With a focus on rehabilitating the creek-line, integrating WSUD systems, and expanding indigenous planting, the project enhances biodiversity, water quality, and access to nature. A central park, inclusive community spaces, and an extensive trail network will connect residents to each other and to the landscapeâ€”offering a healthier, more active lifestyle in the heart of the Scenic Rim.
