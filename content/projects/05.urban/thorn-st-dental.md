Located on a compact corner block, the Thorn St landscape project aimed to create a lively, pedestrian-friendly streetscape that blends green elements into the walkways enhancing both the aesthetics and functionality of the urban space. A robust planting palette and community driven hardscaping features not only elevate the visual appeal but also provide ecological benefits.
