As part of the larger Colmslie Beach Reserve park project, Rickety Bridge was undertaken by FRED St in conjunction with TLCC. The play feature required in-depth technical knowledge and application of the Australian Standards to mitigate entrapment, whilst simultaneously creating an engaging and realistic looking rickety bridge.
