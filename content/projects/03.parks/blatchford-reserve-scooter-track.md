The Blatchford Reserve landscape project introduces a fun and engaging scooter track designed for active play and exploration. Featuring a mix of textured riding surfaces, weaving poles, and playful linemarkings, the track encourages movement, coordination, and creativity. Robust native planting frames the space, adding softness, colour, and a natural feel to the dynamic setting.
