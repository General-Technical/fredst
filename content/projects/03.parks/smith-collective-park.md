Smith Collective Park was delivered in concept design and detailed
design stages as part of upgrades to the public facilities at Commonwealth
Games Village. Centrally located within a residential precinct, the aim was to
provide the community with an all ages and abilities recreational space. In
this constricted site, the selection of play equipment optimised space and
supported ease of access through the space. Landform was strategically used to
generate the most play potential within tight spaces.
