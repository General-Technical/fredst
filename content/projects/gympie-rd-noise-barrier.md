FRED St provided the landscape and urban design treatments for an extensive run of noise barriers along Gympie Rd.  Initially conducting the TMR Landscape Assessment to advise the appropriate level and character of the treatment, FRED St integrated the aestheic into the wider Gympie Rd corridor.  Constrained spaces required a high quality landscape response to mitigate the large insertions into the residents view.  This needed to be balanced with views lines to commercial properties and the Bus Stop infrastructure.  The planting palette was developed to fully utilise the robust native species available to the sub-tropics with the inclusion of the Hoop Pine, added to many landmark plantings along Gympie Rd.
