#### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We pay our respects to the traditional custodians of the land on which we live, work and play. Our office sits on the ancestral lands of the Yugerra and Turrbal, and our work takes us to many other traditional lands of this Country’s First Nation’s people.

We pay our respects to the elders past, present and future and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We acknowledge the some 60,000 years of continuous cultural, spiritual and educational practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and honour the wisdom that will ensure the continuation of their cultures.

#### VISION OF COUNTRY

As a non-indigenous company that has the privilege of influencing our environment and urban spaces, we have a collective desire to play a positive part in our home’s future. Each of us have taken our first steps in reflection. Reflecting has given us an opportunity to listen and start to learn. Taking time to be quiet and letting our First Nations colleagues teach us.

We understand that this journey has only just begun and that the processes of design and culture that we have been a party to, requires unlearning. We want to ensure that we are strong advocates for the voice of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders people and wherever we can, we will look for opportunities to integrate the following tangible outcomes into the consultation, design and implementation of projects we are involved with:
Community support
Capacity building
Health and well-being improvements
Supporting knowledge continuation
Giving a seat at the table - voice
Enable deep listening
Ensuring the response is accurate and accountable
Understanding the onus of relationships

Our vision of Country is one where the sustainability of our environment is intrinsically linked to our lives. Where we can think, feel and act in the interests of the collective. This can only be achieved by becoming students of our First Nations people.
